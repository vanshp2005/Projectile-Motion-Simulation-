#Projectile Motion Simulation
This is a projectile motion simulator that is a physics simulation. There is a chapter in Mechanics called Kinematics which is the study of translational motion. 
Motion that occurs in one dimension or two dimensions. They have parameters that affect their projectile are velocity, initial and final position (vertical, horizontal, or both)
, acceleration. 
This simulation is mainly focused on objects under freefall. 
You will have places where you can enter the given values for the objects parameters and press for the unknown value and the simulation will not only solve for the unknown but
also model the projectile based on the parameters given.
